            <h3>Phishing Scams</h3>
           <p>Scammers send fake emails or messages pretending to be trusted sources. They try to trick you into revealing passwords, bank details, or personal information. They may ask for OTPs or other verification codes to gain access to your accounts. If you share these, your money, accounts, or sensitive data can be stolen without warning.</p>
